## [CDN Online Player](https://idoleg.github.io/cdn-player/)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/idoleg/cdn-player.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/idoleg/cdn-player)

This player is working in browser without server whereby you can watch video direct browser without downloading.

It's use [Plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr) and React.

 Unfortunately, a built-in browser player doesn't have lots of useful features. It does not have video speed control, browsing history and opportunities to create playlists.
